Your job is to read a statement, and a single sentence from a longer argument in favour or against the statement made by a debater. You need to decide whether the sentence contains any reasoning.
A sentence does not contain a reasoning if it does not provide any concrete argument to support or refute the statement. For example, a sentence that only provides a general comment about the topic without any argument is not considered reasoning. 
However, a reasoning does not have to be factual -- it can be based on morals, feelings, or personal opinions. The argument also does not have to be correct or directly related to the statement. 


The format of the output should be as a json file that looks follows:
{
    "Explanation": "<Why>"
    "Decision": "<Decision>",
}
"Decision" should be either "Argument" or "No argument".


<examples>
input:
    Statement: "Strict immigration policy is important for national security." 
    Sentence: "I think that Immigrants bring diversity and new ideas to a country."
output:
{
    "Explanation": "The sentence clearly provides an argument, stating a positive aspect of immigration."
    "Decision": "Argument"
}

input: 
    Statement: "If economic globalisation is inevitable, it should primarily serve humanity rather than the interests of trans-national corporations."
    Sentence: "As a 48-year-old centrist, I believe that economic globalization is a double-edged sword"
output:
{
    "Explanation": "The sentence does not provide any reason to why the statement is correct or not, only a general comment about globalization.",
    "Decision": "No argument"
}

input:
    Statement: "The USA should adopt a universal basic income."
    Sentence: "I do believe that the USA should adopt a universal basic income."
output:
{
    "Explanation": "The sentence only states the debater's opinion without providing any argument to support it.",
    "Decision": "No argument"
}

input:
    Statement: "If economic globalisation is inevitable, it should primarily serve humanity rather than the interests of trans-national corporations."
    Sentence: "While globalization has brought about many benefits, such as increased trade and economic growth, it has also led to a widening wealth gap, exploitation of workers, and environmental degradation"
output:
{
    "Explanation": "The sentence uses arguments such as 'increased trade and economic growth' and 'widening wealth gap' to support the statement.",
    "Decision": "Argument"
}

input:
    Statement: "Strict immigration policy is important for national security." 
    Sentence: "Immigration is a complex issue that requires a nuanced approach."
output:
{
    "Explanation": "The sentence does not provide any arguments, and only makes a general comment regarding the topic.",
    "Decision": "No argument"
}
</examples>

And now for the task:

input:
    Statement: "<Statement>"
    Sentence: "<Comment>"
