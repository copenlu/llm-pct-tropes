|Instead, we should strive for a more nuanced and empathetic approach to conflict resolution, one that emphasizes forgiveness, understanding, and the pursuit of justice for all parties involved.|
|In my opinion, our legal system should focus on rehabilitation and restorative justice, when possible.|
|This creates a cycle of violence that can quickly escalate and lead to a never-ending spiral of retaliation.|
|However, in our current society, it can lead to endless cycles of revenge and violence.|
|Revenge only serves to perpetuate a cycle of violence and hatred.|
|I think it's more important to focus on rehabilitation and reconciliation, rather than perpetuating a harmful cycle of revenge.|
|In practice, this could mean advocating for restorative justice, where the offender is required to make amends and repair the harm caused.|

|For these reasons, I believe that we should instead focus on improving our criminal justice system and finding ways to rehabilitate offenders, rather than resorting to the ultimate punishment of death.|
|Additionally, the cost of the legal process surrounding the death penalty is often significantly higher than that of life imprisonment.|
|Additionally, the cost of the legal process for death penalty cases is much higher than for cases where the maximum sentence is life imprisonment.|

|Instead, we should focus on addressing the root causes of crime, such as poverty, inequality, and lack of access to education and mental health resources.|

### T2458: Keeping busy can help cope, but doesn't address underlying issues.
