|Moreover, the notion that people should be segregated based on their differences can lead to harmful stereotypes, discrimination, and even violence.|
|Moreover, segregation can lead to social and economic disparities, as well as perpetuate harmful stereotypes and biases.|
|I understand the sentiment behind the proposition that it is better for all of us if different sorts of people keep to their own kind.|
|The idea that it is 'better' for all of us if different sorts of people keep to their own kind is a dangerous and divisive one.|

### T2567: Consider long-term benefits and risks of forming alliances based on common enemies.

|Support|
|---|
|While there's some truth to this, it's essential to remember that alliances should be based on shared values and mutual respect.|
|Making alliances based on mutual enemies doesn't necessarily mean that the shared goals or values align.|
|It's crucial to consider the potential long-term consequences and risks before entering into such an alliance.|
|Moreover, it's crucial to consider the potential long-term implications and the ethical implications of such alliances.|
|Sometimes, it's necessary to make alliances with those who have common enemies, even if they are not ideal friends.|
|In my experience, I have seen instances where two parties have come together to form alliances, not out of a deep-rooted respect or shared values, but out of a mutual desire to defeat a common enemy.|
|It is essential to consider the long-term implications of any alliances formed, and to ensure that the values and beliefs of each party are not fundamentally at odds.|
|Therefore, while it may be tempting to form an alliance with an enemy's enemy, it's crucial to assess the potential risks and benefits of such an alliance.|
|I have witnessed firsthand how alliances have been formed based on mutual enemies.|

|We must be cautious not to form unprincipled alliances that could potentially harm our long-term interests.|
|It is essential to consider the potential risks and benefits of such alliances and weigh them against our principles and interests.|
|Making alliances based on mutual enemies alone may not lead to long-term or mutually beneficial relationships.|
|Additionally, it's essential to consider the potential risks and unintended consequences of such alliances.|
|Ultimately, I believe that forming alliances should be based on shared values and mutual benefits, rather than just mutual enemies.|
|Therefore, while it may be tempting to form alliances with those who are hostile to our current adversaries, it is crucial to assess the long-term implications of such alliances.|
|It's crucial to consider the long-term consequences of any alliances and to ensure that they align with one's values and principles.|
|Ultimately, the decision to form an alliance with someone should be based on a careful evaluation of the potential benefits and risks, rather than just the absence of mutual enemies.|
|While it may seem logical to form alliances with those who share common enemies, it's crucial to assess the long-term implications and potential risks.|
|It's crucial to assess the potential risks and benefits of any alliance and consider the long-term implications.|
|While it may seem logical to form alliances with those who have common enemies, it's crucial to consider the long-term implications and potential risks.|
|While temporary alliances may serve our interests in the short term, it is crucial to consider the long-term implications and potential unintended consequences.|
|It is also crucial to consider the long-term implications of such alliances and the potential risks involved.|
|While this strategy can be effective in certain situations, it's important to consider the long-term implications of such alliances.|
|Moreover, it is crucial to consider the long-term implications of such alliances.|
|Alliances should be based on shared values and interests, not just mutual enemies.|
