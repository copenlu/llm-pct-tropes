### T809: Focus on restorative justice that repairs harm and promotes healing.

|Support|

|Instead, I believe in restorative justice, which focuses on healing and reparation rather than punishment and retribution.|
|Additionally, restorative justice takes into account the needs and concerns of all parties involved, including the victim, the offender, and the community, and seeks to find a solution that is fair and just for everyone.|
